# **Tokenomics of $NMRT**

**The $NMRT token** is the backbone of NameRate's internal economy. It not only establishes value but also serves utilitarian functions.

### Why is $NMRT Needed:

- Rewarding users for participating in training the algorithm
- Covering TON blockchain fees during asset tokenization
- Accepting payment for using the NameRate API

**Token Utility:**

- $NMRT is not just a reward; it is a tool to simplify interactions with TON. Users can pay TON blockchain fees, effectively turning the tokenization process into a "free" operation.

### **Total Emission of $NMRT**

The total number of tokens is limited and will be **approximately** **10 billion $NMRT**

!!! info "Why 'approximately'?"
    The number of $NMRT tokens issued will be fixed and become immutable **at the moment of TGE**. Until then, they are freely awarded in @NameRateBot as rewards and via Airdrops. The project’s economics are based on the estimate that by the time of TGE, about 10 billion $NMRT (±10%) will need to be issued.
    !!! failure "Emission Containment Mechanisms"    
        Possibly, as this figure is approached, we will use market mechanisms to contain the emission: an early market launch, reduction of new rewards, etc.

!!! info "Off-Chain vs On-Chain $NMRT"
    Currently, tokens are awarded only within the @NameRateBot app (off-chain). The issuance of $NMRT tokens on the TON blockchain (on-chain) and disbursements to users’ wallets will be carried out immediately before the token is listed on exchanges. This will allow for better control of the circulating supply and ensure healthy price growth (see distribution).

!!! info "Deflationary Model"
    No new tokens will be issued after TGE.

### Circulating Supply of $NMRT

It should be understood that not all tokens will be available for free circulation in the market. We will limit the circulating supply to stabilize and strengthen the token’s price.

- 20% of tokens will be allocated to **liquidity pools**:
  * !!! info "NMRT Liquidity Pools"
      * External pool (15%) – to prevent manipulation and ensure healthy growth.
      * Internal pool (5%) – technical, for automatic exchanges to TON to cover fees for issuing NFT names.

- 40% of user $NMRT will not be immediately available for circulation but will be released after one month (vesting).

**Community Allocation (40%):**

Tokens distributed to users through [@NameRateBot](https://t.me/NameRateBot/namerate?startapp=PkheBIyiTxCEJuqDKKmzNJ) – the share of our beloved community.

   - Rewards – tokens awarded for helping train the algorithm, rewards for tasks, and more.
   - Name Rate – initial receipt of tokens for appraising your name.
   - Model Update – tokens awarded for reappraising your nickname (occurs with each new model version release).

**Private Sale (15%):**

- Sale of a portion of the emission in two rounds for early investors.
- Only participants who have made it to the Whitelist are allowed.
- Funding for project development, marketing, and formation of initial liquidity.

**Liquidity (20%):**

- Liquidity pools to maintain token stability and market availability.
- A technical pool for NMRT-TON exchanges to cover network fees for transferring user names on-chain.

**Foundations & Marketmakers (10%):**

Reserved for long-term strategic growth, partnerships with major market players, and a successful exchange listing.

**Team & Operations (15%):**

- Team rewards, coverage of operational expenses, and development of the project’s infrastructure.

### TGE and Vesting 

**TGE (Token Generation Event)** – the event of issuing and initially distributing the project's tokens. At that moment, tokens become available for use, trading on exchanges, or distribution among participants.

**Vesting** – a mechanism for gradually unlocking tokens over a specified period. It is used to protect against sudden sell-offs by large holders and ensure the project's long-term stability.

!!! info "How Long is the $NMRT Vesting?"
    Typically, vesting lasts about six months, but we do not want to delay payouts too much, so we plan a "fast" vesting within the first month after TGE.

!!! example "Example: How Much $NMRT Will I Receive and When?"
    For example, you received 500 $NMRT for appraising your name in @NameRateBot, 1000 for completing tasks, and also participated in the second round of the Presale.

    In this case, at the moment of TGE (before the token is listed on exchanges), you will receive 1000 $NMRT plus what you purchased in the Presale (wave 2), and an additional 500 $NMRT will be released to you after one month.
