# **About the Project**

NameRate is a project created to help users discover undervalued assets, transform them into NFTs, and earn revenue on the TON blockchain. The main goal is to become **the best digital asset appraisal algorithm** for assets such as nicknames, domains, and numbers.

## **Mission**

All attributes of your account should be uniquely yours. You should have a **clear understanding of the value** of your nicknames and domains.
We strive to create a solution that:

1. **Assesses assets with the highest accuracy and speed**, helping users make informed decisions.
2. **Simplifies name tokenization**, reducing commission costs by using the $NMRT token.
3. **Integrates with leading platforms** for buying and selling NFT nicknames and domains.
4. **Contributes to the development of the TON ecosystem**, making it more user-friendly and accessible for Web3.0 users.

## What Problems NameRate Solves

**Your nickname is not truly yours**
!!! abstract ""
      > Telegram offers a feature called "[Telegram Collectibles](https://core.telegram.org/api/fragment)" that allows you to convert your nickname into an NFT and **gain full control** over it. This procedure requires blockchain expertise, which poses a high barrier to entry for some users.

    NameRate will make this process simple, anonymous, and nearly free.

**Users do not understand the value of their assets**
!!! abstract ""
    > Most names on marketplaces never actually reach auction at the prices for which they were listed. Meanwhile, unscrupulous arbitrage thrives – rare and attractive names are bought from uninformed users and resold at markups of up to x100.

    NameRate will reveal the true potential and suggest an optimal price.

**High commission for creating an NFT name**
!!! abstract ""
    > Today, tokenization is supported by platforms like GetGems and Fragment; however, simply listing a name on an auction is not enough to create an NFT – you **have to pay a commission** (approximately 5 TON) or buy the name from yourself.

    With NameRate, the TON commission is covered through the $NMRT token, which NameRate users receive for free.

**Mandatory verification requirement**
!!! abstract ""
    > If you have tried to convert your nickname into an NFT or list it on an auction, you have likely encountered the need to undergo **document-based verification procedures**.

    NameRate values anonymity highly and does not require any verification beyond what is mandated by The Open Network.

!!! info "Why is this important?" 
    We believe that these issues will become increasingly relevant every year, as the number of beautiful and meaningful nicknames is limited, while the number of Telegram users continues to grow.

## **Why Telegram?**

Telegram is:

1. **A massive audience**: in 5 years, the platform has grown from **200 million to 800 million users**, and that number continues to rise.
2. **Blockchain integration**: Telegram actively promotes TON, making the platform ideal for Web3 implementation.
3. **High demand for nicknames**: with the growing number of users, the demand for meaningful and rare nicknames is continuously increasing.
