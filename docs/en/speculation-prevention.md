# **Speculation Prevention Measures**

We strive to ensure reliable tokenomics and healthy growth for $NMRT. To achieve this, we have formulated several principles that can be adhered to within market mechanisms.

**Fair Distribution**: Initial balances are established with equal access for all users.

**"No Whales" Policy**: Controlling the accumulation of tokens in a single entity to avoid the concentration of market power among major players.

    Limiting large investments:

    - The maximum volume of tokens that a single private investor can purchase during the Private Sale is strictly limited.(2)
    - For private open funds, the maximum volume can be increased proportionally to the declared number of participants.
    - Participation in the Private Sale is open to anyone interested, but strictly through the Whitelist.
    Distribution monitoring: The main indicator is the TOP/BOTTOM 10% and 20% ratios (1)

1. Analogous to R/P. The ratio of the top 10% largest balances to the bottom 10%, adjusted for active users.
2. Depends on the Presale stage (wave1/wave2); see more details in the Presale Whitelist section.

**Counteracting Manipulations:** Stable liquidity pools complicate artificial token price management.

**Transparency and Trust**: All data on token distribution is open and publicly accessible (all on the blockchain).
