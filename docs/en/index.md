# A Name Matters

This is the NameRate documentation â€” a project that turns nicknames and domains into digital assets. Here you will find all the important information: how the algorithm works, why $NMRT is needed, and what awaits you in the future.

We replaced the cumbersome WhitePaper with a convenient documentation format. We will update it at every stage of development.

NameRate has already been launched as a Telegram Mini App, where a referral program and initial tasks are available, so you can already start accumulating your tokens. Discussions are held in our community channel.
