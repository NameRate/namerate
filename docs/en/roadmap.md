# Roadmap

The development of NameRate is divided into several key stages (Eras), each of which encompasses important technological, economic, and strategic steps.

!!! info annotate "Scheduling"
    We intentionally avoid strict adherence to specific dates to maintain development flexibility and prevent false expectations. However, our goal is to successfully complete all five main stages (Accumulation, Community, Distribution, Listing, and Staking) **by the end of 2025**.

At each stage, we will introduce new mechanics, scale the algorithm and community, and prepare the platform for full integration into the Web3 ecosystem. After listing on exchanges and completing the main token distribution phase, NameRate will focus on long-term development.
